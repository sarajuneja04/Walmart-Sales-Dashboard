# Walmart-Sales-Dashboard
I developed comprehensive project in Excel, of Walmart sales dashboard using multiple Charts, pivot table and filters to analyze data. This process consists of multiple stage like data cleaning, data preprocessing and data visualization.

## Project Objective
‚úÖ To find the top selling product by sales across all categories and states.

‚úÖ To identify KPIs

‚úÖ To extract monthly sales trends to increase sales throughout the year.

## Question
1. Comapre Sales & order count in single chart

2. What are the monthly sales trends across all categories?

 3.How does the monthly net profit vary across the year?

4. Which product categories generate the highest total sales and net profit?

5. Which products have the highest units sold?

6. What percentage of total orders status were Delivered on-time or delay?

7. Which states generate the most profit?

8. Are there any states with consistent negative profits?

9. What is the total sales, total net profit, total orders and total units sold?

10. Show a table of products with sales, units sold, and net profit, filterable by category, state, year and month.

11. What are the top-performing products per category or state?
    

## üìù Insights -
1. Sales in December are increasing every year and are above average in each category and state.
2. 40% delay in delivering orders can affect customer satisfaction and customer return rates.
3. Profit margin is 14.9%.
4. California leads with 76.4K Profit (63% of 11 states) followed by Washington with 33.4K Profit.
5. Chairs, phones, tables are among the best-selling categories.
6. Due to low order volume and high prices, copiers generate the highest profit, generating 19.3K profit, followed by accessories and binders.

## üì¢ Recommendations -
1. Seasonal sales and offers on products to attract more customers to increase mid-year sales. 
2. Delay in delivering orders - improve logistics or warehouses count.
3. Cost control and price improvement in a state that is not profitable or has positive profits but very low margins.
4. Increase the price of categories that have high volume but low sales (ex. papers).
